An attempted recreation of the Google homepage.
This learning process helped with using HTML/CSS for page content/layout.
Key learning items: 
--layout, including centering, margins, etc.
--creating horizontal navigation bars
--styling links (i.e. no blue underlined text, creating "Sign in" button)
--styling forms
Items to learn in the future:
--creating a functional form
--more effectively using HTML5 tools to properly section a page
